# Getting Started with Envoy Code Reviewer Agent

Quick start guide for using the Envoy Code Reviewer agent in your development workflow.

## üöÄ Quick Start (2 minutes)

### 1. Verify Installation

Check that all files are in place:

```bash
# From repository root
ls -la .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md       # ‚úÖ Agent prompt
ls -la .claude/commands/envoy-review.md            # ‚úÖ Slash command
ls -la scripts/envoy-review-helper.py        # ‚úÖ Helper script
ls -la tests/ai-review-scenarios/            # ‚úÖ Test scenarios
```

### 2. Test the Helper Script

```bash
# Make sure it's executable
chmod +x scripts/envoy-review-helper.py

# Run a quick test (on current branch vs main)
./scripts/envoy-review-helper.py --format markdown
```

Expected output:
```markdown
# üîç Envoy Code Review Analysis

## üìä Summary
- **Files changed:** X
...
```

### 3. Use in Claude Code

Open Claude Code and type:

```
/envoy-review
```

The agent will analyze your changes and provide a detailed report!

---

## üìã First Real Review

Let's do a real code review with the agent:

### Step 1: Make Some Changes

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-agent-review

# Make a simple change (e.g., add a comment)
echo "// Test comment" >> source/common/http/conn_manager_impl.cc

# Commit it
git add source/common/http/conn_manager_impl.cc
git commit -m "test: agent review"
```

### Step 2: Run the Review

**Option A: In Claude Code**
```
/envoy-review
```

**Option B: Command Line**
```bash
./scripts/envoy-review-helper.py --format markdown
```

### Step 3: Understand the Output

The agent will report:

```markdown
## ‚ùå Critical Issues
- Missing release note (if user-facing change)
- Missing test coverage (if code change)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
- Style issues
- Pattern violations

## ‚úÖ Passing Checks
- What's correct

## üìù Action Items
- Specific fixes needed
```

### Step 4: Fix Issues

Address each critical issue:

```bash
# Example: Add missing release note
vim changelogs/current.yaml

# Re-run review
/envoy-review

# Iterate until all checks pass
```

---

## üîÑ Typical Workflow

### Daily Development Flow

```bash
# 1. Start new feature
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature

# 2. Develop incrementally
vim source/extensions/filters/http/my_filter/filter.cc
git commit -m "wip: initial implementation"

# 3. Review early (catch issues early!)
/envoy-review

# 4. Fix issues
# (address feedback)

# 5. Continue development
vim source/extensions/filters/http/my_filter/filter.cc
git commit -m "feat: complete implementation"

# 6. Final review before PR
/envoy-review

# 7. Create PR when clean
git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
gh pr create
```

### Pre-PR Checklist

Before creating a PR, ensure:

```bash
# ‚úÖ All changes committed
git status

# ‚úÖ Review passes
/envoy-review
# ‚Üí No critical issues

# ‚úÖ Tests pass locally
bazel test //test/...

# ‚úÖ Format is clean
bazel run //tools/code_format:check_format -- check

# ‚úÖ Ready to push
git push
```

---

## üß™ Testing the Agent

### Run Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all test scenarios
./tests/ai-review-scenarios/run-all-scenarios.sh
```

This validates that the agent correctly detects:
- Missing test coverage
- Missing release notes
- Style violations

### Manual Testing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Missing Test**
```bash
git checkout -b test-missing-test
touch source/common/http/new_file.cc
git add source/common/http/new_file.cc
git commit -m "test: file without test"
/envoy-review
# ‚Üí Should detect missing test
```

**Scenario 2: Missing Release Note**
```bash
git checkout -b test-missing-note
echo "// feature" >> source/common/http/conn_manager_impl.cc
git commit -am "feat: new feature"
/envoy-review
# ‚Üí Should detect missing release note
```

**Scenario 3: Everything Perfect**
```bash
git checkout -b test-perfect
# Make change with test + release note
/envoy-review
# ‚Üí Should pass all checks ‚úÖ
```

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Review Early and Often

```bash
# Don't wait until code is "done"
# Review during development to catch issues early

git commit -m "wip: partial implementation"
/envoy-review  # ‚Üê Get early feedback
```

### Tip 2: Use Helper Script for Quick Checks

```bash
# Quick check without opening Claude Code
./scripts/envoy-review-helper.py --format text

# Save report for later
./scripts/envoy-review-helper.py --format markdown > review.md
```

### Tip 3: Focus on Critical Issues First

```markdown
Agent output priorities:
1. ‚ùå Critical Issues ‚Üí Must fix before merge
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Warnings ‚Üí Should fix (improves quality)
3. üí° Suggestions ‚Üí Nice to have (optional)
```

### Tip 4: Learn Envoy Standards

```bash
# Use agent to learn Envoy policies
/envoy-review

# Read the "why" behind each issue
# Apply learnings to future code
# Become a better Envoy contributor!
```

### Tip 5: Iterate Quickly

```bash
# Fast iteration loop:
/envoy-review  # Find issue
# Fix it
git commit --amend --no-edit
/envoy-review  # Verify fix
# Repeat
```

## üîß Customization

### Change Base Branch

Edit `.claude/commands/envoy-review.md`:

```markdown
# Default: compares to 'main'
# Change to compare to different branch:

Please analyze changes compared to `develop` branch...
```

### Adjust Strictness

Edit `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`:

```markdown
# Make warnings into critical issues:
**Critical:** Shared pointer usage (was: Warning)

# Or relax requirements for certain files:
**Skip coverage check for:** test utilities, mocks
```

### Add Project-Specific Checks

Add to `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`:

```markdown
### X. Custom Project Check

**Check for:**
- Your specific pattern

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Your verification command
```

**Report as:**
- Critical/Warning/Suggestion
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "/envoy-review command not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls -la .claude/commands/envoy-review.md

# Check file permissions
chmod 644 .claude/commands/envoy-review.md
```

### Issue: "No changes detected"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Changes must be committed
git add .
git commit -m "your message"

# Then run review
/envoy-review
```

### Issue: "Helper script fails"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.7+)
python3 --version

# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/envoy-review-helper.py

# Test directly
python3 scripts/envoy-review-helper.py --verbose
```

### Issue: "Agent gives wrong advice"

**Solution:**
- Agent isn't perfect - use human judgment
- Check against official docs (CONTRIBUTING.md, STYLE.md)
- Ask maintainers if unsure
- File issue to improve agent prompt
