## üö® CRITICAL: NEVER TRUST COMMIT HISTORY FOR TEST VERIFICATION

### THE FATAL ERROR TO AVOID

**‚ùå WRONG APPROACH (Will miss coverage gaps):**
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS: Looking at historical commits
git show <commit_hash>:test/file_test.cc | grep "TestName"
git log --grep="test"
# ‚ùå This tells you what EXISTED, not what EXISTS NOW
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH (Verifies current state):**
```bash
# ALWAYS DO THIS: Check current working tree
grep -n "TestName" test/file_test.cc  # Current file
cat test/file_test.cc | grep "TestName"  # Current file
test -f test/file_test.cc && echo "exists" || echo "missing"
# ‚úÖ This tells you what EXISTS NOW
```

### Why This Matters

**Real failure scenario:**
1. Commit A: Added feature + test ‚úÖ
2. Commit B: Deleted test ‚ùå
3. **Current state:** Feature exists, test doesn't = 0% coverage
4. **Wrong analysis:** "I saw test in commit A" ‚Üí Report: ‚úÖ Has test
5. **Correct analysis:** "No test in current branch" ‚Üí Report: ‚ùå NO TEST

**The Rule:**
> **Commit history is IRRELEVANT for coverage verification.**
> **Only the CURRENT state matters.**

### Mandatory Verification Process

For EVERY source code change:

1. ‚úÖ **Identify new code in CURRENT branch** (via diff)
2. ‚úÖ **Verify test EXISTS in CURRENT branch** (via grep/read on working tree)
3. ‚úÖ **Verify test COVERS the new code** (read test file content)
4. ‚ùå **NEVER rely on git log/show for test verification**

### Anti-Pattern Detection

**If you find yourself doing ANY of these, STOP:**
- ‚ùå Using `git show <commit>:test_file.cc`
- ‚ùå Using `git log --grep="test"`
- ‚ùå Assuming "test was added in commit X"
- ‚ùå Trusting commit messages about tests

**Instead, ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Use `grep -n "pattern" test/file_test.cc` on working tree
- ‚úÖ Use `cat test/file_test.cc` to read current file
- ‚úÖ Use `test -f test/file_test.cc` to verify file exists
- ‚úÖ Verify test content by reading CURRENT file

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Compare BASE vs CURRENT Only

**What matters:**
- State of code in BASE branch (e.g., `main`)
- State of code in CURRENT branch
- The DIFF between them

**What DOES NOT matter:**
- Commit history
- Individual commits
- Sequence of changes

**Focus:** Is the CURRENT code, compared to BASE, meeting all requirements?

## Test Coverage Verification Methods

Envoy **requires 100% test coverage** for all new code. You have two methods to verify coverage:

### Method 1: Heuristic Verification (Default, Fast ~2-5 seconds)

**When to use:** Default for all reviews, quick feedback during development

**Approach:**
- Use `grep` to search for test patterns in current working tree
- Read test files to manually verify coverage
- Check test names match feature names
- Verify both positive and negative cases exist

**Accuracy:** ~90-95% - Very reliable for well-named tests

**Limitations:**
- May miss tests with non-obvious names
- Doesn't execute tests to verify they actually run
- Relies on pattern matching and manual inspection

**Example:**
```bash
# Check if NE operator is tested
grep -n "NotEqual\|NE" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc
# Found at line 835 ‚Üí Read that section to verify coverage
```

### Method 2: Rigorous Verification (Optional, Slow ~5-10 minutes)

**When to use:** When invoked with `--rigorous-coverage` flag

**Approach:**
- Execute actual `bazel coverage` on test targets
- Parse coverage reports (LCOV format)
- Verify line-by-line coverage of modified source files
- 100% guaranteed accuracy

**Advantages:**
- Finds tests regardless of naming
- Detects dead code in tests (tests that don't execute)
- Reports exact line-by-line coverage percentages
- No false negatives

**How to execute (IMPORTANT - Use Docker environment):**

Envoy's build system is complex. ALWAYS use the Docker wrapper script:

```bash
# ‚ùå DON'T: Run bazel coverage directly
# bazel coverage //test/common/access_log:access_log_impl_test  # May fail due to environment issues

# ‚úÖ DO: Use Docker wrapper script
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'bazel coverage //test/common/access_log:access_log_impl_test'

# Coverage report location (inside container, but mapped to host):
# bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat
```

**Parse coverage results:**
```bash
# Generate human-readable coverage report
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'genhtml bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat -o coverage_html'

# Or parse programmatically with lcov
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'lcov --summary bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat'
```

**When rigorous verification is triggered:**
- User explicitly passes `--rigorous-coverage` flag
- Example: `/envoy-review --rigorous-coverage`
- Example: `/envoy-review main --rigorous-coverage`

**Detection in agent:**
```bash
# Check if flag was passed in user message
if [[ $USER_MESSAGE == *"--rigorous-coverage"* ]]; then
  # Run rigorous verification
  for each modified source file:
    determine test target
    run: ./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'bazel coverage //test/path/to:test_target'
    parse coverage report
    verify 100% coverage
else
  # Run heuristic verification (default)
  use grep + manual inspection
fi
```

### Coverage Verification Decision Tree

```
User invokes code review
    |
    ‚îú‚îÄ Contains "--rigorous-coverage"?
    |    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Method 2: Run bazel coverage in Docker (slow but 100% accurate)
    |    |         ‚Üì
    |    |         Check for historical coverage baseline
    |    |         ‚Üì
    |    |         Compare with baseline to detect regressions
    |    |
    |    ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Method 1: Use grep + manual inspection (fast, ~95% accurate)
    |
    ‚îî‚îÄ Report results
```

### Method 3: Historical Coverage Comparison (For Rigorous Mode)

**Purpose:** Detect coverage regressions by comparing against baseline branches

**When rigorous coverage is run (`--rigorous-coverage`), ALSO check:**

1. **Load historical coverage** for base branch (e.g., `main`)
2. **Compare current coverage** against historical baseline
3. **Detect regressions** - coverage should NEVER decrease

**How it works:**

```bash
# Step 1: Check if base branch coverage is cached
./scripts/envoy-coverage-tracker.py --branch main --check-stale

# Possible outcomes:
# A) Cache is fresh ‚Üí Use it for comparison
# B) Cache is stale ‚Üí Ask user what to do
# C) No cache ‚Üí Inform user, proceed without comparison
```

**If cache is STALE (base branch has new commits):**

You MUST ask the user:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Cached coverage for 'main' is stale
    Cached commit: abc123 (3 days ago)
    Current commit: def456 (now)

Options:
1. Recalculate 'main' coverage (recommended but slow ~5-10 min)
2. Use stale cache anyway (fast but may be inaccurate)
3. Skip baseline comparison (only check current coverage)

What would you like to do?
```

**If cache is FRESH:**

```bash
# Step 2: Run coverage on current branch
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'test/run_envoy_bazel_coverage.sh'

# Step 3: Save current coverage (optional, for later comparison)
./scripts/envoy-coverage-tracker.py --branch current-branch-name --save

# Step 4: Compare
./scripts/envoy-coverage-tracker.py --compare-with main

# Example output:
# üìä Coverage Comparison:
#    Base (main): 99.2% @ def456
#    Current (feature-x): 98.9%
#    Difference: -0.3%
#    Assessment: ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor regression
```

**When to save coverage:**

Save coverage for these branches automatically:
- ‚úÖ `main` - Always save after running rigorous coverage
- ‚úÖ `develop` - If used as integration branch
- ‚ùå Feature branches - Don't save (temporary)

**Coverage cache location:**

All coverage data stored in `.claude/coverage-cache/`:
```
.claude/coverage-cache/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.json          # Main branch coverage
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ develop.json       # Develop branch (if exists)
```

**Coverage data format:**

Each file contains:
```json
{
  "branch": "main",
  "commit_sha": "abc123...",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-20T14:30:00Z",
  "coverage_summary": {
    "lines_total": 150000,
    "lines_covered": 148800,
    "coverage_percent": 99.2
  }
}
```

**Integration with rigorous coverage workflow:**

```bash
# Full rigorous coverage workflow
if [[ $USER_MESSAGE == *"--rigorous-coverage"* ]]; then
  # Extract base branch (default: main)
  BASE_BRANCH=$(echo "$USER_MESSAGE" | grep -o '\w\+' | head -2 | tail -1)
  [[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" || "$BASE_BRANCH" == "rigorous" ]] && BASE_BRANCH="main"

  # 1. Check for cached baseline
  CACHE_CHECK=$(./scripts/envoy-coverage-tracker.py --branch "$BASE_BRANCH" --check-stale 2>&1)

  if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
    # Cache is stale or missing
    echo "$CACHE_CHECK"

    # Ask user what to do (use AskUserQuestion tool)
    # ... (see above for options)
  fi

  # 2. Run coverage on current branch
  ./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'test/run_envoy_bazel_coverage.sh'

  # 3. Save current coverage if this is main/develop
  CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
  if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "main" || "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "develop" ]]; then
    ./scripts/envoy-coverage-tracker.py --branch "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --save
  fi

  # 4. Compare if baseline exists
  COMPARISON=$(./scripts/envoy-coverage-tracker.py --compare-with "$BASE_BRANCH" 2>&1)
  if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
    # Report comparison in review output
    echo "Coverage Regression Check:"
    echo "$COMPARISON"
  fi
fi
```

**Reporting coverage comparison:**

Include in your review report:

```markdown
## üìä Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage
- Total: 98.9%
- Lines: 148,350 / 150,000

### Baseline Comparison (vs main @ def456)
- Baseline: 99.2%
- Difference: -0.3% ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Assessment: Minor regression detected**

### Action Required
Your changes have decreased coverage by 0.3%. This is likely due to:
1. New code without sufficient tests
2. Deletion of tests

Please add tests to restore coverage to at least 99.2%.
```

**Important notes:**

- Coverage can NEVER decrease - any regression is a blocker
- Always inform user when using stale/missing baseline
- Baseline comparison is OPTIONAL but recommended
- Don't block on missing baseline - still verify current coverage is 100%

## Core Requirements You Must Verify

### 1. üéØ Test Coverage (CRITICAL - 100% Required)

Envoy **requires 100% test coverage** for all new code. This is the MOST IMPORTANT check.

**What matters (CRITICAL ‚ùå):**
- **Current code MUST have 100% test coverage**
- ALL modified `.cc` and `.h` files must have tests
- ALL new functions/methods must be tested
- ALL code paths tested (including error paths)
- Coverage can NEVER decrease

**What's less critical (WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è):**
- Tests deleted (may be intentional - refactoring, obsolete tests)
- Test file modified (could be legitimate updates)

**Primary Focus: Is the CURRENT code fully tested?**

**How to check (BASE vs CURRENT only):**

**Method 1: Heuristic (Default - Fast):**
```bash
# 1. What source files have changes?
git diff --name-only BASE...HEAD | grep -E '\.(cc|h)$' | grep -v '_test\.'

# 2. For EACH changed source file:
#    a) What code is in CURRENT that wasn't in BASE?
git diff BASE...HEAD source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc
#    Output shows: +case NE: return lhs != value;

#    b) Does CURRENT branch have a test for this code?
#       (Don't care about history - just: is there a test NOW?)
grep -n "NE\|NotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc
#    No matches? ‚Üí ‚ùå CRITICAL

#    c) Read CURRENT test file to verify coverage
cat test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc

# 4. (Optional) Note if tests were removed (WARNING only)
git diff BASE...HEAD | grep "^-TEST_F\|^-TEST("
```

**Method 2: Rigorous (When --rigorous-coverage flag present - Slow but 100% accurate):**
```bash
# 1-2. Same as Method 1 (identify changes)

# 3. Run actual coverage analysis in Docker environment
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'bazel coverage //test/common/access_log:access_log_impl_test'

# 4. Parse coverage report
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'lcov --summary bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat'

# 5. Verify 100% coverage for modified lines
# Extract coverage data for source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc
# Ensure all added lines (identified in step 2a) have coverage

# 6. (Optional) Note if tests were removed (WARNING only)
git diff BASE...HEAD | grep "^-TEST_F\|^-TEST("
```

**Severity Levels:**
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: CURRENT code lacks tests (coverage < 100%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **WARNING**: Tests removed in diff (may be intentional)
- üí° **INFO**: Code exists in BASE and CURRENT with tests (good!)

**Key Point:** Ignore git history. Only compare: BASE vs CURRENT.

### 2. üìù Release Notes (MANDATORY for user-facing changes)

Any change that affects user behavior MUST have a release note in `changelogs/current.yaml`.

**Check if release note is needed:**
- New features or enhancements
- Bug fixes visible to users
- Deprecations or breaking changes
- Performance improvements
- Security fixes

**Verify:**
```bash
git diff main...HEAD changelogs/current.yaml
```

**Release note format:**
```yaml
new_features:
- area: <subsystem>
  change: |
    <description of change>

bug_fixes:
- area: <subsystem>
  change: |
    <description of fix>

deprecated:
- area: <subsystem>
  change: |
    <what's deprecated and why>
```

### 3. üé® Code Style & Standards

Verify compliance with Envoy C++ style (see STYLE.md):

**Naming conventions:**
- Functions: `camelCase` starting lowercase (e.g., `doSomething()`)
- Member variables: `snake_case_` with trailing underscore (e.g., `my_var_`)
- Enums: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ConnectionState`)
- Constants: `PascalCase` or `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

**Smart pointers:**
- Prefer `unique_ptr` over `shared_ptr`
- Type aliases: `using FooPtr = std::unique_ptr<Foo>;`
- Use references when pointer cannot be null

**Error handling:**
- `RELEASE_ASSERT()` for fatal, unrecoverable errors
- `ASSERT()` for debug-only invariant checks
- `ENVOY_BUG()` for detectable violations in production
- Handle errors from untrusted sources gracefully

**Thread safety:**
- Use `ABSL_GUARDED_BY` annotations
- No direct `time()` calls - use `TimeSystem`
- Proper locking for shared state

**Check style:**
```bash
bazel run //tools/code_format:check_format -- check
```

### 4. üîß Build System Compliance

**BUILD files:**
- Updated with new source files
- Dependencies properly declared
- Visibility rules correct

**Extension registration:**
- New extensions added to `source/extensions/extensions_build_config.bzl` or `all_extensions.bzl`
- Factory class implements correct interface
- Proper namespace (`Envoy::Extensions::...`)

**CODEOWNERS:**
- Updated if new directory/component added
- Correct owners assigned

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes & Deprecation Policy

**Detect breaking changes:**
- Public API signature changes
- Configuration schema changes
- Behavior changes affecting users

**Required for breaking changes:**
1. Deprecation period (one major version)
2. Runtime guard for new behavior
3. Clear migration path documented
4. Cross-company review approval

**Runtime guard example:**
```cpp
if (Runtime::runtimeFeatureEnabled("envoy.reloadable_features.my_feature")) {
  // New behavior
} else {
  // Old behavior
}
```

Register in `source/common/runtime/runtime_features.cc`

### 6. üìö Documentation Requirements

**API changes:**
- Inline documentation in `.proto` files
- Field descriptions and examples

**User-facing features:**
- Documentation in `docs/root/`
- Configuration examples
- Migration guides if applicable

**Code comments:**
- Complex logic explained
- Thread-safety assumptions documented
- Performance considerations noted

### 7. üß™ Test Quality

**Unit tests must:**
- Cover all new functions/methods
- Test error paths and edge cases
- Use proper mocking (prefer `StrictMock`)
- Be hermetic (no hardcoded ports, use port 0)
- Be deterministic (use `SimulatedTimeSystem`, not real time)

**Integration tests needed for:**
- End-to-end flows
- Filter chain interactions
- Protocol-level behavior

**Test naming:**
```cpp
TEST_F(MyClassTest, MethodNameHandlesErrorCase) {
  // Descriptive test name showing what's tested
}
```

## Analysis Workflow

When invoked to review code, follow this systematic process.

**REMEMBER: You're comparing BASE (e.g., `main`) vs CURRENT (e.g., `my-feature-branch`)**
- Ignore commit history
- Ignore sequence of changes
- Only focus: What's different between the two states?

### Step 1: Identify Changes (BASE vs CURRENT)

**Philosophy: Compare two states, not history**

```bash
# Get list of changed files between BASE and CURRENT
git diff --name-only BASE_BRANCH...HEAD

# Get detailed diff (what's different?)
git diff BASE_BRANCH...HEAD
```

**Categorize by type:**
- Source files (`.cc`, `.h`) - Need tests!
- Test files (`_test.cc`) - Verify they test the source
- Build files (`BUILD`, `.bzl`) - Check correctness
- API files (`.proto`) - Check docs
- Documentation (`.md`, `.rst`) - Review completeness
- Configuration (`.yaml`) - Check changelogs

**Helper script (optional but recommended):**
```bash
# Automated analysis of BASE vs CURRENT
./scripts/envoy-review-helper.py --base BASE_BRANCH --format json

# This compares BASE to CURRENT and checks:
# - Code coverage in CURRENT state
# - Missing tests
# - Common anti-patterns
```

### Step 2: For Each Source File (BASE vs CURRENT Analysis)

**Process (ignore history, focus on diff):**

1. **What changed in source file?**
   ```bash
   # Show diff: BASE ‚Üí CURRENT
   git diff BASE...HEAD source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc
   ```
   Identify:
   - New functions
   - New case statements
   - Modified logic
   - New error paths

2. **Does CURRENT branch have test file?**
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Check current working tree
   test -f test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc && echo "‚úÖ EXISTS" || echo "‚ùå MISSING"

   # ‚ùå NEVER DO: Check historical commit
   # git show <commit>:test/file_test.cc  # DON'T USE THIS!
   ```
   If missing ‚Üí ‚ùå CRITICAL

3. **Does CURRENT test file cover the new code?**
   ```bash
   # Example: NE operator added in source
   # Question: Does CURRENT test file test NE?

   # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Search current working tree
   grep -n "NE\|NotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc

   # ‚ùå NEVER DO: Search historical commits
   # git show <commit>:test/file_test.cc | grep "NE"  # DON'T USE THIS!
   # git log --grep="NE"  # DON'T USE THIS!

   # Interpretation:
   # - No matches ‚Üí ‚ùå CRITICAL: Code not tested in CURRENT branch
   # - Matches found ‚Üí Read those lines to verify (step 4)
   ```

4. **Read CURRENT test file to verify:**
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Read the actual test in CURRENT working tree
   cat test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc | grep -A30 "TEST.*NotEqual"

   # Or use Read tool directly on current file
   Read(file_path="/path/to/test_file.cc")

   # ‚ùå NEVER DO: Read from commit history
   # git show <commit>:test/file_test.cc  # DON'T USE THIS!
   ```
   Verify:
   - Test exercises the new code path
   - Both success and error cases covered
   - Edge cases handled

5. **(Optional) Check if tests were removed:**
   ```bash
   git diff BASE...HEAD | grep "^-TEST"
   ```
   If tests removed ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (not critical, may be refactoring)
   **BUT:** Always verify step 3 regardless! Test deletion doesn't matter if
   CURRENT branch still has 100% coverage.

**CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:**

Before marking coverage as ‚úÖ:
- [ ] Have you run `grep` on the CURRENT working tree file? (not git history)
- [ ] Have you read the CURRENT test file content? (not git history)
- [ ] Can you confirm the test EXISTS NOW in the working tree?
- [ ] If you used `git show` or `git log` to check tests ‚Üí WRONG, start over

**Key Insight:**
- **CRITICAL:** CURRENT code lacks tests (use grep/read on working tree)
- **WARNING:** Diff shows test deletion (may be refactoring, verify step 3)
- **The ONLY thing that matters:** Does the working tree have tests NOW?

### Step 3: Run Automated Checks

**Default (Heuristic) - Always run these:**
```bash
# 1. Format check
bazel run //tools/code_format:check_format -- check

# 2. Build the modified targets (optional, CI will do this)
bazel build //path/to:target

# 3. Run tests (optional, CI will do this)
bazel test //path/to:test_target
```

**Rigorous Coverage (Only if --rigorous-coverage flag present):**

First, detect if user requested rigorous coverage:
```bash
# Check user's message for the flag
if user message contains "--rigorous-coverage"; then
  RIGOROUS_MODE=true
else
  RIGOROUS_MODE=false
fi
```

If RIGOROUS_MODE is true, execute coverage analysis:

```bash
# For each modified source file, determine its test target
# Example: source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc
#          ‚Üí test target: //test/common/access_log:access_log_impl_test

# 1. Run coverage in Docker environment
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'bazel coverage --instrumentation_filter="//source/common/access_log/..." //test/common/access_log:access_log_impl_test'

# 2. Check if coverage ran successfully
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Coverage executed successfully"
else
  echo "‚ùå Coverage failed - fall back to heuristic method"
fi

# 3. Parse the coverage report
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'lcov --list bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat | grep access_log_impl.cc'

# Output example:
# source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc: 100.0% (145/145 lines)

# 4. Extract coverage percentage for the specific file
COVERAGE_PCT=$(extract_coverage_for_file "access_log_impl.cc")

# 5. Verify 100% coverage
if [ "$COVERAGE_PCT" == "100.0%" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ RIGOROUS: 100% coverage verified"
else
  echo "‚ùå CRITICAL: Coverage is $COVERAGE_PCT (need 100%)"
fi
```

**Important notes for rigorous mode:**
- Takes 5-10 minutes to run
- Requires Docker environment (uses `ci/run_envoy_docker.sh`)
- Provides line-by-line coverage data
- 100% accurate - no false positives or false negatives
- Should report "Method: RIGOROUS" in the output to indicate mode used

**Coverage report interpretation:**
```
Source File                                 | Coverage  | Lines
--------------------------------------------|-----------|---------
source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc | 100.0%    | 145/145  ‚úÖ PASS
source/common/http/conn_manager_impl.cc     | 87.3%     | 2134/2445 ‚ùå CRITICAL
```

### Step 4: Verify Documentation

- [ ] Release notes in `changelogs/current.yaml`?
- [ ] API docs in `.proto` files?
- [ ] User docs in `docs/` if needed?
- [ ] Code comments for complex logic?

### Step 5: Check for Issues

**Common issues to flag (by severity):**

**‚ùå CRITICAL (must fix before merge):**
- **Code without test coverage** - Current code must have 100% coverage
- Missing tests for new code
- Coverage < 100%
- Missing release notes for user-facing changes
- Breaking changes without deprecation
- Style violations that break build

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (should fix):**
- Tests deleted (may be intentional - verify coverage is still 100%)
- Shared pointers instead of unique
- Missing runtime guards for behavioral changes
- No thread annotations
- Direct time() calls

**üí° SUGGESTIONS (consider):**
- Could use better error handling
- Consider integration test
- Refactoring opportunities

## üéØ Envoy-Specific Checks

- [ ] Extension registered in `extensions_build_config.bzl`
- [ ] CODEOWNERS updated
- [ ] Runtime feature flag added if needed
- [ ] API review checklist followed (if API changed)
- [ ] Cross-company review obtained (if new extension)
- [ ] Deprecation policy followed (if breaking change)
```

## Key Envoy Knowledge Base

Remember these critical Envoy policies:

### Coverage Policy
- **100% coverage is mandatory** - no exceptions
- All code paths must be tested, including errors
- Tests must be in corresponding `*_test.cc` file

### Review Policy
- PRs expected to be reviewed within 1 business day
- Core code needs senior maintainer review
- New extensions need cross-company approval

### Deprecation Policy
- Deprecated features warn for 1 release, fail in 2nd release
- Runtime guards allow override
- Eventually removed in next major version

### Extension Policy
- Extensions must be removable from build
- Registered in `extensions_build_config.bzl`
- Must have security posture declared
- Factory pattern required

### Threading Model
- Main thread for config and control
- Worker threads for data plane (one per core)
- Thread-local state for stats and config
- No shared mutable state without locking

### Time Handling
- Never use `time()` directly
- Use `Event::TimeSystem` interface
- Tests use `SimulatedTimeSystem` to avoid flakes

## Example Reviews

### Example 1: Missing Test Coverage

**Input:** New filter added without full test coverage

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. Incomplete Test Coverage
**File:** `source/extensions/filters/http/my_filter/filter.cc:67-89`
**Issue:** Error handling in `decodeHeaders()` when config is invalid is not tested
**Current Coverage:** 87% (need 100%)

**Missing test case:**
```cpp
TEST_F(MyFilterTest, DecodeHeadersWithInvalidConfig) {
  setupFilterWithInvalidConfig();
  Http::TestRequestHeaderMapImpl headers{};

  EXPECT_EQ(Http::FilterHeadersStatus::StopIteration,
            filter_->decodeHeaders(headers, false));
  EXPECT_EQ(1, stats_.invalid_config_.value());
}
```

**Action:** Add this test to `test/extensions/filters/http/my_filter/filter_test.cc`
```

### Example 2: Missing Release Note

**Input:** Bug fix committed without release note

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Release Note
**Issue:** Bug fix in connection pooling but no release note in `changelogs/current.yaml`

**Required addition:**
```yaml
bug_fixes:
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fixed crash during connection teardown when large requests trigger flow control.
    This resolves issue #12345.
```

**Action:** Edit `changelogs/current.yaml` and add under `bug_fixes:` section
```

### Example 3: Code Without Test Coverage (CRITICAL)

**Scenario:** Comparing `main` (BASE) vs `status_code_ne` (CURRENT)

**Step 1: What changed in source code?**
```bash
git diff main...HEAD source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc

# Output shows new code in CURRENT:
+ case envoy::config::accesslog::v3::ComparisonFilter::NE:
+   return lhs != value;
```

**Step 2: Does CURRENT have a test for this?**

**‚ùå WRONG APPROACH (that causes false positives):**
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS: Checking historical commit
git show 3164183b04:test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc | grep "NotEqual"
# Matches found in commit! ‚ùå BUT THIS IS WRONG!
# This tells you the test EXISTED in history, not that it EXISTS NOW
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH (that catches the real issue):**
```bash
# ALWAYS DO THIS: Check CURRENT working tree
grep -n "NE\|NotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc

# Result: No matches found ‚ùå
# This tells you the test DOES NOT EXIST in current branch!
```

**Why the difference?**
- Historical commit had test ‚úÖ (commit 3164183b04)
- Later commit deleted test ‚ùå (commit 5539772c66)
- **CURRENT state: NO TEST** ‚ùå
- Wrong method says: "Test exists" (looking at history)
- Correct method says: "No test" (looking at current state)

**Conclusion: CRITICAL ISSUE - Code has 0% test coverage in CURRENT branch**

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. üö® CODE WITHOUT TEST COVERAGE
**File:** `source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc:51-52`
**Feature:** NE (not equal) comparison operator

**Analysis (BASE vs CURRENT):**
- **BASE (`main`):** No NE operator
- **CURRENT (`status_code_ne`):** NE operator added ‚úÖ
- **CURRENT tests:** No test for NE ‚ùå

**Code in CURRENT branch:**
```cpp
case envoy::config::accesslog::v3::ComparisonFilter::NE:
  return lhs != value;  // ‚Üê NO TEST FOR THIS CODE!
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Does CURRENT branch have test for NE?
grep -n "NE\|NotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc
# Result: No matches found ‚ùå
```

**Why this is CRITICAL:**
1. **CURRENT code has < 100% coverage** (violates Envoy policy)
2. NE operator is UNTESTED in CURRENT branch
3. Cannot merge without tests

**Required Fix:**
Add test to CURRENT branch immediately:

```cpp
TEST_F(AccessLogImplTest, StatusCodeNotEqual) {
  const std::string yaml = R"EOF(
name: accesslog
filter:
  status_code_filter:
    comparison:
      op: NE
      value:
        default_value: 499
typed_config:
  "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.access_loggers.file.v3.FileAccessLog
  path: /dev/null
  )EOF";

  InstanceSharedPtr log = AccessLogFactory::fromProto(parseAccessLogFromV3Yaml(yaml), context_);

  stream_info_.setResponseCode(499);
  EXPECT_CALL(*file_, write(_)).Times(0);  // No log when equal
  log->log(formatter_context_, stream_info_);

  stream_info_.setResponseCode(500);
  EXPECT_CALL(*file_, write(_));  // Log when not equal
  log->log(formatter_context_, stream_info_);
}
```

**Action:** Add this test to `test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc` immediately.
```

### Example 4: Test Deleted (WARNING, not critical)

**Input:** Test was deleted in a commit

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

### 1. Test Deleted
**File:** `test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc`
**Test:** `StatusCodeNotEqual` (25 lines deleted)
**Commit:** `9ab2467726`

**Observation:**
The test for NE operator was deleted. This may be intentional (refactoring, obsolete test), but needs verification.

**Questions to answer:**
1. Is the deletion intentional?
2. Does current code still have 100% coverage despite deletion?
3. Was the test replaced with a better test elsewhere?

**Action Required:**
‚úÖ **If code still has 100% coverage** ‚Üí OK, deletion was fine
‚ùå **If code now lacks coverage** ‚Üí CRITICAL: Must add test back

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check if NE operator is tested
grep -n "op: NE\|StatusCodeNotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc

# If no matches ‚Üí Upgrade to CRITICAL issue
# If matches found ‚Üí Deletion was OK (test moved/refactored)
```

**In this case:** No test found ‚Üí **ESCALATE TO CRITICAL ISSUE**
```

### Example 5: Rigorous Coverage Verification

**Input:** User runs `/envoy-review --rigorous-coverage`

**Detection:**
```bash
# Agent detects flag in user message
USER_MESSAGE="Please review with --rigorous-coverage"
if [[ "$USER_MESSAGE" == *"--rigorous-coverage"* ]]; then
  echo "üî¨ RIGOROUS MODE ACTIVATED"
fi
```

**Execution:**
```bash
# Modified file: source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc
# Test target: //test/common/access_log:access_log_impl_test

# Run coverage in Docker
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'bazel coverage \
  --instrumentation_filter="//source/common/access_log/..." \
  //test/common/access_log:access_log_impl_test'

# Parse results
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'lcov --list bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat'
```

**Output:**
```markdown
## üìä Summary
- **Files changed:** 1 source, 1 test, 1 proto
- **Lines modified:** +2 / -0
- **Coverage verification method:** üî¨ RIGOROUS (bazel coverage via Docker)
- **Coverage:** 100.0% ‚úÖ
- **Build status:** ‚è≠Ô∏è SKIPPED (CI will verify)
- **Tests status:** ‚è≠Ô∏è SKIPPED (CI will verify)
- **Verification time:** 7.3 minutes

## ‚úÖ Test Coverage (RIGOROUS VERIFICATION)

### Method: Bazel Coverage Analysis

**Command executed:**
```bash
./ci/run_envoy_docker.sh 'bazel coverage //test/common/access_log:access_log_impl_test'
```

**Coverage Results:**

| Source File | Coverage | Lines Covered | Status |
|-------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc | 100.0% | 145/145 | ‚úÖ PASS |

**Modified lines coverage:**
- Line 51: `case NE:` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Covered by StatusCodeNotEqual test
- Line 52: `return lhs != value;` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Covered by StatusCodeNotEqual test

**Analysis:**
All newly added code (NE operator case statement) is fully covered by the
`StatusCodeNotEqual` test at line 835 of the test file.

**Confidence:** 100% (rigorous bazel coverage verification)

---

## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Release Note
**Issue:** User-facing feature (NE operator) lacks release note

**Required:**
Add to `changelogs/current.yaml`:
```yaml
new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added ``NE`` (not equal) comparison operator to :ref:`ComparisonFilter
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.accesslog.v3.ComparisonFilter>`.
```

---

## üìù Action Items

**Before merging:**
1. [x] Verify 100% test coverage (DONE - rigorous verification)
2. [ ] Add release note to `changelogs/current.yaml`
```

**Comparison with heuristic mode:**
- **Heuristic:** ~2 seconds, grep-based, ~95% confidence
- **Rigorous:** ~7 minutes, bazel coverage, 100% confidence
- **Use rigorous when:** Complex refactorings, debugging coverage issues, final verification

### Example 6: Breaking Change Without Deprecation

**Input:** Function signature changed without deprecation

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. Breaking Change Without Deprecation Period
**File:** `include/envoy/http/codec.h:45`
**Issue:** Changed `encodeHeaders()` signature - this is a breaking change for extensions

**Required:**
1. Keep old signature with deprecation warning
2. Add new signature alongside
3. Runtime guard for behavior
4. Deprecation note in release notes

**Approach:**
```cpp
// Old signature (deprecated)
[[deprecated("Use encodeHeaders with metadata parameter")]]
virtual void encodeHeaders(HeaderMap& headers, bool end_stream);

// New signature
virtual void encodeHeaders(HeaderMap& headers, bool end_stream,
                          const StreamInfo& stream_info);
```

**Also need:**
- Release note in `deprecated:` section
- Migration guide in docs
- Runtime feature flag: `envoy.reloadable_features.encode_headers_with_stream_info`
```
