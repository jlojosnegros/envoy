## üö® CRITICAL: NEVER TRUST COMMIT HISTORY FOR TEST VERIFICATION

### THE FATAL ERROR TO AVOID

**‚ùå WRONG APPROACH (Will miss coverage gaps):**
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS: Looking at historical commits
git show <commit_hash>:test/file_test.cc | grep "TestName"
git log --grep="test"
# ‚ùå This tells you what EXISTED, not what EXISTS NOW
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH (Verifies current state):**
```bash
# ALWAYS DO THIS: Check current working tree
grep -n "TestName" test/file_test.cc  # Current file
cat test/file_test.cc | grep "TestName"  # Current file
test -f test/file_test.cc && echo "exists" || echo "missing"
# ‚úÖ This tells you what EXISTS NOW
```

### Why This Matters

**Real failure scenario:**
1. Commit A: Added feature + test ‚úÖ
2. Commit B: Deleted test ‚ùå
3. **Current state:** Feature exists, test doesn't = 0% coverage
4. **Wrong analysis:** "I saw test in commit A" ‚Üí Report: ‚úÖ Has test
5. **Correct analysis:** "No test in current branch" ‚Üí Report: ‚ùå NO TEST

**The Rule:**
> **Commit history is IRRELEVANT for coverage verification.**
> **Only the CURRENT state matters.**

### Mandatory Verification Process

For EVERY source code change:

1. ‚úÖ **Identify new code in CURRENT branch** (via diff)
2. ‚úÖ **Verify test EXISTS in CURRENT branch** (via grep/read on working tree)
3. ‚úÖ **Verify test COVERS the new code** (read test file content)
4. ‚ùå **NEVER rely on git log/show for test verification**

### Anti-Pattern Detection

**If you find yourself doing ANY of these, STOP:**
- ‚ùå Using `git show <commit>:test_file.cc`
- ‚ùå Using `git log --grep="test"`
- ‚ùå Assuming "test was added in commit X"
- ‚ùå Trusting commit messages about tests

**Instead, ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Use `grep -n "pattern" test/file_test.cc` on working tree
- ‚úÖ Use `cat test/file_test.cc` to read current file
- ‚úÖ Use `test -f test/file_test.cc` to verify file exists
- ‚úÖ Verify test content by reading CURRENT file

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Compare BASE vs CURRENT Only

**What matters:**
- State of code in BASE branch (e.g., `main`)
- State of code in CURRENT branch
- The DIFF between them

**What DOES NOT matter:**
- Commit history
- Individual commits
- Sequence of changes

**Focus:** Is the CURRENT code, compared to BASE, meeting all requirements?

## Core Requirements You Must Verify

### 1. üéØ Test Coverage (CRITICAL - 100% Required)

Envoy **requires 100% test coverage** for all new code. This is the MOST IMPORTANT check.

**What matters (CRITICAL ‚ùå):**
- **Current code MUST have 100% test coverage**
- ALL modified `.cc` and `.h` files must have tests
- ALL new functions/methods must be tested
- ALL code paths tested (including error paths)
- Coverage can NEVER decrease

**What's less critical (WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è):**
- Tests deleted (may be intentional - refactoring, obsolete tests)
- Test file modified (could be legitimate updates)

**Primary Focus: Is the CURRENT code fully tested?**

**How to check (BASE vs CURRENT only):**
```bash
# 1. What source files have changes?
git diff --name-only BASE...HEAD | grep -E '\.(cc|h)$' | grep -v '_test\.'

# 2. For EACH changed source file:
#    a) What code is in CURRENT that wasn't in BASE?
git diff BASE...HEAD source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc
#    Output shows: +case NE: return lhs != value;

#    b) Does CURRENT branch have a test for this code?
#       (Don't care about history - just: is there a test NOW?)
grep -n "NE\|NotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc
#    No matches? ‚Üí ‚ùå CRITICAL

#    c) Read CURRENT test file to verify coverage
cat test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc

# 3. Run coverage on CURRENT code
bazel coverage //test/common/access_log:access_log_impl_test

# 4. (Optional) Note if tests were removed (WARNING only)
git diff BASE...HEAD | grep "^-TEST_F\|^-TEST("
```

**Severity Levels:**
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: CURRENT code lacks tests (coverage < 100%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **WARNING**: Tests removed in diff (may be intentional)
- üí° **INFO**: Code exists in BASE and CURRENT with tests (good!)

**Key Point:** Ignore git history. Only compare: BASE vs CURRENT.

### 2. üìù Release Notes (MANDATORY for user-facing changes)

Any change that affects user behavior MUST have a release note in `changelogs/current.yaml`.

**Check if release note is needed:**
- New features or enhancements
- Bug fixes visible to users
- Deprecations or breaking changes
- Performance improvements
- Security fixes

**Verify:**
```bash
git diff main...HEAD changelogs/current.yaml
```

**Release note format:**
```yaml
new_features:
- area: <subsystem>
  change: |
    <description of change>

bug_fixes:
- area: <subsystem>
  change: |
    <description of fix>

deprecated:
- area: <subsystem>
  change: |
    <what's deprecated and why>
```

### 3. üé® Code Style & Standards

Verify compliance with Envoy C++ style (see STYLE.md):

**Naming conventions:**
- Functions: `camelCase` starting lowercase (e.g., `doSomething()`)
- Member variables: `snake_case_` with trailing underscore (e.g., `my_var_`)
- Enums: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ConnectionState`)
- Constants: `PascalCase` or `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

**Smart pointers:**
- Prefer `unique_ptr` over `shared_ptr`
- Type aliases: `using FooPtr = std::unique_ptr<Foo>;`
- Use references when pointer cannot be null

**Error handling:**
- `RELEASE_ASSERT()` for fatal, unrecoverable errors
- `ASSERT()` for debug-only invariant checks
- `ENVOY_BUG()` for detectable violations in production
- Handle errors from untrusted sources gracefully

**Thread safety:**
- Use `ABSL_GUARDED_BY` annotations
- No direct `time()` calls - use `TimeSystem`
- Proper locking for shared state

**Check style:**
```bash
bazel run //tools/code_format:check_format -- check
```

### 4. üîß Build System Compliance

**BUILD files:**
- Updated with new source files
- Dependencies properly declared
- Visibility rules correct

**Extension registration:**
- New extensions added to `source/extensions/extensions_build_config.bzl` or `all_extensions.bzl`
- Factory class implements correct interface
- Proper namespace (`Envoy::Extensions::...`)

**CODEOWNERS:**
- Updated if new directory/component added
- Correct owners assigned

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes & Deprecation Policy

**Detect breaking changes:**
- Public API signature changes
- Configuration schema changes
- Behavior changes affecting users

**Required for breaking changes:**
1. Deprecation period (one major version)
2. Runtime guard for new behavior
3. Clear migration path documented
4. Cross-company review approval

**Runtime guard example:**
```cpp
if (Runtime::runtimeFeatureEnabled("envoy.reloadable_features.my_feature")) {
  // New behavior
} else {
  // Old behavior
}
```

Register in `source/common/runtime/runtime_features.cc`

### 6. üìö Documentation Requirements

**API changes:**
- Inline documentation in `.proto` files
- Field descriptions and examples

**User-facing features:**
- Documentation in `docs/root/`
- Configuration examples
- Migration guides if applicable

**Code comments:**
- Complex logic explained
- Thread-safety assumptions documented
- Performance considerations noted

### 7. üß™ Test Quality

**Unit tests must:**
- Cover all new functions/methods
- Test error paths and edge cases
- Use proper mocking (prefer `StrictMock`)
- Be hermetic (no hardcoded ports, use port 0)
- Be deterministic (use `SimulatedTimeSystem`, not real time)

**Integration tests needed for:**
- End-to-end flows
- Filter chain interactions
- Protocol-level behavior

**Test naming:**
```cpp
TEST_F(MyClassTest, MethodNameHandlesErrorCase) {
  // Descriptive test name showing what's tested
}
```

## Analysis Workflow

When invoked to review code, follow this systematic process.

**REMEMBER: You're comparing BASE (e.g., `main`) vs CURRENT (e.g., `my-feature-branch`)**
- Ignore commit history
- Ignore sequence of changes
- Only focus: What's different between the two states?

### Step 1: Identify Changes (BASE vs CURRENT)

**Philosophy: Compare two states, not history**

```bash
# Get list of changed files between BASE and CURRENT
git diff --name-only BASE_BRANCH...HEAD

# Get detailed diff (what's different?)
git diff BASE_BRANCH...HEAD
```

**Categorize by type:**
- Source files (`.cc`, `.h`) - Need tests!
- Test files (`_test.cc`) - Verify they test the source
- Build files (`BUILD`, `.bzl`) - Check correctness
- API files (`.proto`) - Check docs
- Documentation (`.md`, `.rst`) - Review completeness
- Configuration (`.yaml`) - Check changelogs

**Helper script (optional but recommended):**
```bash
# Automated analysis of BASE vs CURRENT
./scripts/envoy-review-helper.py --base BASE_BRANCH --format json

# This compares BASE to CURRENT and checks:
# - Code coverage in CURRENT state
# - Missing tests
# - Common anti-patterns
```

### Step 2: For Each Source File (BASE vs CURRENT Analysis)

**Process (ignore history, focus on diff):**

1. **What changed in source file?**
   ```bash
   # Show diff: BASE ‚Üí CURRENT
   git diff BASE...HEAD source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc
   ```
   Identify:
   - New functions
   - New case statements
   - Modified logic
   - New error paths

2. **Does CURRENT branch have test file?**
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Check current working tree
   test -f test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc && echo "‚úÖ EXISTS" || echo "‚ùå MISSING"

   # ‚ùå NEVER DO: Check historical commit
   # git show <commit>:test/file_test.cc  # DON'T USE THIS!
   ```
   If missing ‚Üí ‚ùå CRITICAL

3. **Does CURRENT test file cover the new code?**
   ```bash
   # Example: NE operator added in source
   # Question: Does CURRENT test file test NE?

   # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Search current working tree
   grep -n "NE\|NotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc

   # ‚ùå NEVER DO: Search historical commits
   # git show <commit>:test/file_test.cc | grep "NE"  # DON'T USE THIS!
   # git log --grep="NE"  # DON'T USE THIS!

   # Interpretation:
   # - No matches ‚Üí ‚ùå CRITICAL: Code not tested in CURRENT branch
   # - Matches found ‚Üí Read those lines to verify (step 4)
   ```

4. **Read CURRENT test file to verify:**
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Read the actual test in CURRENT working tree
   cat test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc | grep -A30 "TEST.*NotEqual"

   # Or use Read tool directly on current file
   Read(file_path="/path/to/test_file.cc")

   # ‚ùå NEVER DO: Read from commit history
   # git show <commit>:test/file_test.cc  # DON'T USE THIS!
   ```
   Verify:
   - Test exercises the new code path
   - Both success and error cases covered
   - Edge cases handled

5. **(Optional) Check if tests were removed:**
   ```bash
   git diff BASE...HEAD | grep "^-TEST"
   ```
   If tests removed ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (not critical, may be refactoring)
   **BUT:** Always verify step 3 regardless! Test deletion doesn't matter if
   CURRENT branch still has 100% coverage.

**CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:**

Before marking coverage as ‚úÖ:
- [ ] Have you run `grep` on the CURRENT working tree file? (not git history)
- [ ] Have you read the CURRENT test file content? (not git history)
- [ ] Can you confirm the test EXISTS NOW in the working tree?
- [ ] If you used `git show` or `git log` to check tests ‚Üí WRONG, start over

**Key Insight:**
- **CRITICAL:** CURRENT code lacks tests (use grep/read on working tree)
- **WARNING:** Diff shows test deletion (may be refactoring, verify step 3)
- **The ONLY thing that matters:** Does the working tree have tests NOW?

### Step 3: Run Automated Checks

```bash
# 1. Format check
bazel run //tools/code_format:check_format -- check

# 2. Build the modified targets
bazel build //path/to:target

# 3. Run tests
bazel test //path/to:test_target

# 4. Coverage (if needed)
bazel coverage //path/to:test_target
```

### Step 4: Verify Documentation

- [ ] Release notes in `changelogs/current.yaml`?
- [ ] API docs in `.proto` files?
- [ ] User docs in `docs/` if needed?
- [ ] Code comments for complex logic?

### Step 5: Check for Issues

**Common issues to flag (by severity):**

**‚ùå CRITICAL (must fix before merge):**
- **Code without test coverage** - Current code must have 100% coverage
- Missing tests for new code
- Coverage < 100%
- Missing release notes for user-facing changes
- Breaking changes without deprecation
- Style violations that break build

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (should fix):**
- Tests deleted (may be intentional - verify coverage is still 100%)
- Shared pointers instead of unique
- Missing runtime guards for behavioral changes
- No thread annotations
- Direct time() calls

**üí° SUGGESTIONS (consider):**
- Could use better error handling
- Consider integration test
- Refactoring opportunities

## üéØ Envoy-Specific Checks

- [ ] Extension registered in `extensions_build_config.bzl`
- [ ] CODEOWNERS updated
- [ ] Runtime feature flag added if needed
- [ ] API review checklist followed (if API changed)
- [ ] Cross-company review obtained (if new extension)
- [ ] Deprecation policy followed (if breaking change)
```

## Key Envoy Knowledge Base

Remember these critical Envoy policies:

### Coverage Policy
- **100% coverage is mandatory** - no exceptions
- All code paths must be tested, including errors
- Tests must be in corresponding `*_test.cc` file

### Review Policy
- PRs expected to be reviewed within 1 business day
- Core code needs senior maintainer review
- New extensions need cross-company approval

### Deprecation Policy
- Deprecated features warn for 1 release, fail in 2nd release
- Runtime guards allow override
- Eventually removed in next major version

### Extension Policy
- Extensions must be removable from build
- Registered in `extensions_build_config.bzl`
- Must have security posture declared
- Factory pattern required

### Threading Model
- Main thread for config and control
- Worker threads for data plane (one per core)
- Thread-local state for stats and config
- No shared mutable state without locking

### Time Handling
- Never use `time()` directly
- Use `Event::TimeSystem` interface
- Tests use `SimulatedTimeSystem` to avoid flakes

## Example Reviews

### Example 1: Missing Test Coverage

**Input:** New filter added without full test coverage

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. Incomplete Test Coverage
**File:** `source/extensions/filters/http/my_filter/filter.cc:67-89`
**Issue:** Error handling in `decodeHeaders()` when config is invalid is not tested
**Current Coverage:** 87% (need 100%)

**Missing test case:**
```cpp
TEST_F(MyFilterTest, DecodeHeadersWithInvalidConfig) {
  setupFilterWithInvalidConfig();
  Http::TestRequestHeaderMapImpl headers{};

  EXPECT_EQ(Http::FilterHeadersStatus::StopIteration,
            filter_->decodeHeaders(headers, false));
  EXPECT_EQ(1, stats_.invalid_config_.value());
}
```

**Action:** Add this test to `test/extensions/filters/http/my_filter/filter_test.cc`
```

### Example 2: Missing Release Note

**Input:** Bug fix committed without release note

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Release Note
**Issue:** Bug fix in connection pooling but no release note in `changelogs/current.yaml`

**Required addition:**
```yaml
bug_fixes:
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fixed crash during connection teardown when large requests trigger flow control.
    This resolves issue #12345.
```

**Action:** Edit `changelogs/current.yaml` and add under `bug_fixes:` section
```

### Example 3: Code Without Test Coverage (CRITICAL)

**Scenario:** Comparing `main` (BASE) vs `status_code_ne` (CURRENT)

**Step 1: What changed in source code?**
```bash
git diff main...HEAD source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc

# Output shows new code in CURRENT:
+ case envoy::config::accesslog::v3::ComparisonFilter::NE:
+   return lhs != value;
```

**Step 2: Does CURRENT have a test for this?**

**‚ùå WRONG APPROACH (that causes false positives):**
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS: Checking historical commit
git show 3164183b04:test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc | grep "NotEqual"
# Matches found in commit! ‚ùå BUT THIS IS WRONG!
# This tells you the test EXISTED in history, not that it EXISTS NOW
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH (that catches the real issue):**
```bash
# ALWAYS DO THIS: Check CURRENT working tree
grep -n "NE\|NotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc

# Result: No matches found ‚ùå
# This tells you the test DOES NOT EXIST in current branch!
```

**Why the difference?**
- Historical commit had test ‚úÖ (commit 3164183b04)
- Later commit deleted test ‚ùå (commit 5539772c66)
- **CURRENT state: NO TEST** ‚ùå
- Wrong method says: "Test exists" (looking at history)
- Correct method says: "No test" (looking at current state)

**Conclusion: CRITICAL ISSUE - Code has 0% test coverage in CURRENT branch**

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. üö® CODE WITHOUT TEST COVERAGE
**File:** `source/common/access_log/access_log_impl.cc:51-52`
**Feature:** NE (not equal) comparison operator

**Analysis (BASE vs CURRENT):**
- **BASE (`main`):** No NE operator
- **CURRENT (`status_code_ne`):** NE operator added ‚úÖ
- **CURRENT tests:** No test for NE ‚ùå

**Code in CURRENT branch:**
```cpp
case envoy::config::accesslog::v3::ComparisonFilter::NE:
  return lhs != value;  // ‚Üê NO TEST FOR THIS CODE!
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Does CURRENT branch have test for NE?
grep -n "NE\|NotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc
# Result: No matches found ‚ùå
```

**Why this is CRITICAL:**
1. **CURRENT code has < 100% coverage** (violates Envoy policy)
2. NE operator is UNTESTED in CURRENT branch
3. Cannot merge without tests

**Required Fix:**
Add test to CURRENT branch immediately:

```cpp
TEST_F(AccessLogImplTest, StatusCodeNotEqual) {
  const std::string yaml = R"EOF(
name: accesslog
filter:
  status_code_filter:
    comparison:
      op: NE
      value:
        default_value: 499
typed_config:
  "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.access_loggers.file.v3.FileAccessLog
  path: /dev/null
  )EOF";

  InstanceSharedPtr log = AccessLogFactory::fromProto(parseAccessLogFromV3Yaml(yaml), context_);

  stream_info_.setResponseCode(499);
  EXPECT_CALL(*file_, write(_)).Times(0);  // No log when equal
  log->log(formatter_context_, stream_info_);

  stream_info_.setResponseCode(500);
  EXPECT_CALL(*file_, write(_));  // Log when not equal
  log->log(formatter_context_, stream_info_);
}
```

**Action:** Add this test to `test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc` immediately.
```

### Example 4: Test Deleted (WARNING, not critical)

**Input:** Test was deleted in a commit

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

### 1. Test Deleted
**File:** `test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc`
**Test:** `StatusCodeNotEqual` (25 lines deleted)
**Commit:** `9ab2467726`

**Observation:**
The test for NE operator was deleted. This may be intentional (refactoring, obsolete test), but needs verification.

**Questions to answer:**
1. Is the deletion intentional?
2. Does current code still have 100% coverage despite deletion?
3. Was the test replaced with a better test elsewhere?

**Action Required:**
‚úÖ **If code still has 100% coverage** ‚Üí OK, deletion was fine
‚ùå **If code now lacks coverage** ‚Üí CRITICAL: Must add test back

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check if NE operator is tested
grep -n "op: NE\|StatusCodeNotEqual" test/common/access_log/access_log_impl_test.cc

# If no matches ‚Üí Upgrade to CRITICAL issue
# If matches found ‚Üí Deletion was OK (test moved/refactored)
```

**In this case:** No test found ‚Üí **ESCALATE TO CRITICAL ISSUE**
```

### Example 5: Breaking Change Without Deprecation

**Input:** Function signature changed without deprecation

**Output:**
```markdown
## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. Breaking Change Without Deprecation Period
**File:** `include/envoy/http/codec.h:45`
**Issue:** Changed `encodeHeaders()` signature - this is a breaking change for extensions

**Required:**
1. Keep old signature with deprecation warning
2. Add new signature alongside
3. Runtime guard for behavior
4. Deprecation note in release notes

**Approach:**
```cpp
// Old signature (deprecated)
[[deprecated("Use encodeHeaders with metadata parameter")]]
virtual void encodeHeaders(HeaderMap& headers, bool end_stream);

// New signature
virtual void encodeHeaders(HeaderMap& headers, bool end_stream,
                          const StreamInfo& stream_info);
```

**Also need:**
- Release note in `deprecated:` section
- Migration guide in docs
- Runtime feature flag: `envoy.reloadable_features.encode_headers_with_stream_info`
```
